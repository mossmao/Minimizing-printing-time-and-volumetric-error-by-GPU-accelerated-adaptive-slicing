Minimizing printing time and volumetric error by GPU-accelerated adaptive slicing

## Cuda / Visual Studio Setting

CUDA 10.0 is used.

VS 2015 is tested.

## Run the code
### Step 1: sample the STL into rays

run the LDNI-sampling.sln

a) LDNI sampling, (resolution 1024)

b) AM adaptive slicing

c) copy the files to matlab folder

### Step 2: dynamic programming to slice the part with adaptive layer thickness
run main_.m
