Minimizing printing time and volumetric error by GPU-accelerated adaptive slicing

## Run the code
### Step 1: sample the STL into rays

### Step 2: dynamic programming to slice the part with adaptive layer thickness
1, run main_.m
2, to get the data, run the LDNI-sampling.sln
a) LDNI sampling, (resolution 1024)
b) AM adaptive slicing
c) copy the files to matlab folder
